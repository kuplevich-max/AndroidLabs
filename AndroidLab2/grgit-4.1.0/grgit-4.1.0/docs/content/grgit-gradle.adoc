## Applying the Plugin

Get the available versions from the link:https://github.com/ajoberstar/grgit/releases[releases] page. Generally, you should only apply the plugin to the root project of your build.

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'org.ajoberstar.grgit' version '<version>'
}
```

## What does the plugin do?

The `org.ajoberstar.grgit` plugin adds a `grgit` property to your build, which is an instance of link:http://ajoberstar.org/grgit/docs/grgit-core/groovydoc/org/ajoberstar/grgit/Grgit.html[Grgit] opened to the repository visible from your project's root dir. This will check the project directory and its parents for a `.git` directory. If no repository is found, the `grgit` property is `null`.

```groovy
version = "1.0.0-${grgit.head().abbreviatedId}"

task tagRelease {
  description = 'Tags the current head with the project\'s version.'
  doLast {
    grgit.tag.add {
      name = version
      message = "Release of ${version}"
    }
  }
}

task pushToOrigin {
  description = 'Pushes current branch\'s committed changes to origin repo.'
  doLast {
    grgit.push()
  }
}
```

For details on the available operations, see the link:grgit-reference.html[reference]. Examples are provided there.

## Just getting the library

If you don't want to interact with the project's repository, but still want to

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'org.ajoberstar.grgit' version '<version>' apply false
}
```

Then you can import Grgit and continue from there:

```groovy
import org.ajoberstar.grgit.Grgit

task cloneSomeRepo {
  doLast {
    def grgit = Grgit.clone(dir: "$buildDir/my-repo", uri: "https://github.com/ajoberstar/grgit.git")
    println grgit.describe()
  }
}
```

## Authentication

If you will be doing a clone, fetch, push, or pull, review the link:grgit-authentication.html[grgit-authentication] page for details on how to configure credentials for these commands.

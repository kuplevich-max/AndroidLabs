== Description


`grgit.branch.current()`:: Returns the current link:http://ajoberstar.org/grgit/docs/grgit-core/groovydoc/org/ajoberstar/grgit/Branch.html[Branch].
`grgit.branch.list()`:: Returns a list of branches (link:http://ajoberstar.org/grgit/docs/grgit-core/groovydoc/org/ajoberstar/grgit/Branch.html[Branch]). The branches returned can be filtered using `mode` and `contains`.
`grgit.branch.add(name: <name>, startPoint: <startPoint>, mode: <mode>)`:: Creates a new branch named `<name>` pointing at `<startPoint>`, possibly tracking a remote depending on `<mode>`. Returns the created link:http://ajoberstar.org/grgit/docs/grgit-core/groovydoc/org/ajoberstar/grgit/Branch.html[Branch].
`grgit.branch.change(name: <name>, startPoint: <startPoint>, mode: <mode>)`:: Modify an existing branch named `<name>` pointing at `<startPoint>`, possibly tracking a remote depending on `<mode>`. Returns the modified link:http://ajoberstar.org/grgit/docs/grgit-core/groovydoc/org/ajoberstar/grgit/Branch.html[Branch].
`grgit.branch.remove(names: [<name>, ...], force: <boolean>)`:: Removes one or more branches. Returns a `List<String>` of branch names removed.

== Options

=== list

mode:: (`String`, default `local`) Must be one of `local`, `remote`, `all`.
`local`:::: Only list local branches (i.e. those under `refs/heads`)
`remote`:::: Only list remote branches (i.e. those under `refs/remotes`)
`all`:::: List all branches
contains:: (`Object`, default `null`) Only list branches which contain the specified commit.  (`Object`, default `null`) Start the new branch at this commit. For a more complete list of acceptable inputs, see link:grgit-resolve.html[grgit-resolve] (specifically the `toRevisionString` method).

=== add or change

name:: (`String`, default `null`) Name of the branch
startPoint:: (`Object`, default `null`) Start the new branch at this commit. For a more complete list of acceptable inputs, see link:grgit-resolve.html[grgit-resolve] (specifically the `toRevisionString` method).
mode:: (`String`, default `null`) Must be one of `'track'` or `'no-track'` or `null`
`track`:::: When creating a new branch, set up `branch.<name>.remote` and `branch.<name>.merge` configuration entries to mark the start-point branch as "upstream" from the new branch. It directs link:grgit-pull.html[grgit-pull] without arguments to pull from the upstream when the new branch is checked out.
+
This behavior is the default when the start point is a remote-tracking branch. Set the `branch.autoSetupMerge` configuration variable to `false` if you want link:grgit-checkout.html[grgit-checkout] and `grgit-branch` to always behave as if `no-track` were given. Set it to `always` if you want this behavior when the start-point is either a local or remote-tracking branch.
`no-track`:::: Do not set up "upstream" configuration, even if the branch.autoSetupMerge configuration variable is true.

=== remove

names:: (`List<Object>`, default `[]`) Names of the branches. For a more complete list of acceptable inputs, see link:grgit-resolve.html[grgit-resolve] (specifically the `toBranchName` method).
force:: (`boolean`, default `false`) Set to `true` to allow deleting branches that are not merged into another branch already.

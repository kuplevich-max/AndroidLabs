== Description

Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, "refs") from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated (see the description of <refspec> below for ways to control this behavior).

By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that you are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using a `tagMode` of `'all'` or `'none'' or by configuring `remote.<name>.tagOpt`. By using a refspec that fetches tags explicitly, you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested in as well.

When no remote is specified, by default the origin remote will be used, unless thereâ€™s an upstream branch configured for the current branch.

== Options

remote:: (`String`, default `null`) The "remote" repository that is source of a fetch operation. This parameter can be either a URL or the name of a remote.
refspecs:: (`List<String>`, default `[]`) Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update. When no <refspec>s are provided, the refs to fetch are read from `remote.<repository>.fetch` variables instead.
+
The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus +, followed by the source ref <src>, followed by a colon :, followed by the destination ref <dst>. The colon can be omitted when <dst> is empty.
+
The remote ref that matches <src> is fetched, and if <dst> is not empty string, the local ref that matches it is fast-forwarded using <src>. If the optional plus + is used, the local ref is updated even if it does not result in a fast-forward update.
prune:: (`boolean`, default `false`) Before fetching, remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote. Tags are not subject to pruning if they are fetched only because of the default tag auto-following or due to a `tagMode` option. However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec, then they are also subject to pruning.
tagMode:: (`String`, default `auto`) Must be one of `'auto'`, `'all'`, `'none'`.
+
`'auto'` - tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally.
+
`'none'` - disables automatic tag following.
+
`'all'` - Fetch all tags from the remote (i.e., fetch remote tags `refs/tags/*` into local tags with the same name), in addition to whatever else would otherwise be fetched.

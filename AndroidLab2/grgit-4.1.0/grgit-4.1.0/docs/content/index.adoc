== What is Grgit?

A library providing a wrapper around link:https://eclipse.org/jgit/[Eclipse's JGit] for more fluent usage from Groovy. This allows you to interact easily with link:https://git-scm.com[Git] repositories from general applications using Groovy or from Gradle builds.

== Where do I get Grgit?

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of Grgit 3, the coordinates for the library have changed.

* Instead of:
** `org.ajoberstar:grgit:<version>`
* Use one of:
** org.ajoberstar.grgit:grgit-core:<version>
** org.ajoberstar.grgit:grgit-gradle:<version>

The Gradle plugin ID **has not** changed. It is still `org.ajoberstar.grgit`.
====

To use Grgit as a library, add a dependency on it to link:https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter[JCenter]. Available versions can be found in the link:https://github.com/ajoberstar/grgit/releases[release notes].

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
repositories {
  jcenter()
}

dependencies {
  compile 'org.ajoberstar.grgit:grgit-core:<version>'
}
----

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<!-- make sure you've specified JCenter in your repositories -->
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.ajoberstar.grgit</groupId>
    <artifactId>grgit-core</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

To use Grgit in a Gradle build, see the documentation for link:grgit-gradle.html[org.ajoberstar.grgit].

== How do I use Grgit?

First you need to get an instance of Grgit, by either link:grgit-init.html[initializing] a new repo or link:grgit-open.html[opening] or link:grgit-clone.html[cloning] an existing repo.

Once you have a Grgit instance, you can use the available operations to inspect or modify the repo. Each operation has 3 variants, depending on your preference:

[source, groovy]
----
// no arg variant, only applies to operations that don't require input
grgit.log()

// map argument variant
grgit.log(includes: ['master', 'other-branch'], excludes: ['old-stuff'], skipCommits: 5)

// closure argument variant
grgit.log {
  range('1.0.0', '1.5.1')
  maxCommits = 2
}
----

Look in the link:grgit-reference.html[grgit-reference] documentation for information on each available operation, it's options, and example usage. Additionally, see the link:grgit-authentication.html[authentication] documentation if you plan to interact with a remote repository.

== Example Usage

In an example like this, using the HTTP protocol, you'll likely need to specify basic auth credentials. This can be done via system properties or environment variables. SSH access (including ssh-agent and Pageant) are also supported. (Again, see the link:grgit-authentication.html[authentication] documentation.)

[source]
.Environment Variables
----
GRGIT_USER=somebody
GRGIT_PASS=myauthtoken
----

[source, groovy]
.grgitSample.groovy
----
// get a grgit instance
def grgit = Grgit.clone(dir: 'test-repo', uri: 'https://github.com/ajoberstar/test-repo.git')

// make some changes
new File('test-repo/file.txt') << 'making some changes'
grgit.add(patterns: ['test-repo/file.txt'])

// make a commit
grgit.commit(message: 'Adding a new file')

// view the commits
grgit.log {
  range('origin/master', 'master')
}.each { commit ->
  println "${commit.id} ${commit.shortMessage}"
}

// push to the remote
grgit.push()

// cleanup after yourself
grgit.close()

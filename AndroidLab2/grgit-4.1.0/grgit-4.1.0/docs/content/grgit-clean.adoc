== Name

grgit-clean - Remove untracked files from the working tree

== Synopsis

[source, groovy]
----
grgit.clean()
----

[source, groovy]
----
grgit.clean(paths: ['<path>', ...], directories: <boolean>, dryRun: <boolean>, ignore: <boolean>)
----

[source, groovy]
----
grgit.clean {
  paths = ['<path>', ...]
  directories = <boolean>
  dryRun = <boolean>
  ignore = <boolean>
}
----

== Description

Cleans the working tree by removing files that are not under version control.

Normally, only files uknown to Git are removed, but if `ignore` is `false`, ignored files are also removed. This can, for example, be useful to remove all build products.

If any optional `paths` are given, only those paths are affected.

Returns a `Set<String>` of the paths that were deleted.

== Options

directories:: (`boolean`, default `false`) Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files.
dryRun:: (`boolean`, default `false`) Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.
ignore:: (`boolean`, default `true`) Don’t use the standard ignore rules read from .gitignore (per directory) and $GIT_DIR/info/exclude. This allows removing all untracked files, including build products. This can be used (possibly in conjunction with git reset) to create a pristine working directory to test a clean build.
paths:: (`Set<String>`, default `null`) Only remove files in the given paths.

== Examples

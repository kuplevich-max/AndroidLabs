grgit-log - Show commit logs

== Synopsis

[source, groovy]

grgit.log()

[source, groovy]

grgit.log(includes: [<revstr>, ...], excludes: [<revstr>, ...], paths: [<path>, ...],
  skipCommits: <int>, maxCommits: <int>)

[source, groovy]
----
grgit.log {
  includes = [<revstr>, ...]
  excludes = [<revstr>, ...]
  paths = [<path>, ...]
  skipCommits = <int>
  maxCommits = <int>
  range(<revstr since>, <revstr until>)
}

== Description

Shows the commit logs.

List commits that are reachable by following the parent links from the given  `includes` commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with the `excludes` option. The output is given in reverse chronological order.

You can think of this as a set operation. Commits given in `includes` form a set of commits that are reachable from any of them, and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with `excludes` are subtracted from that set. The remaining commits are what comes out in the result. Various other options and paths parameters can be used to further limit the result.

Thus, the following command means "list all the commits which are reachable from foo or bar, but not from baz".

[source, groovy]
----
grgit.log(includes: ['foo', 'bar'], excludes: ['baz'])
----

A special notation (in the Closure syntax only) `range(<commit1>, <commit2>)` can be used as a short-hand for `excludes: [<commit2>], includes: [<commit1>]`. For example, either of the following may be used interchangeably:

[source, groovy]
----
grgit.log(includes: ['HEAD'], excludes: ['origin/master'])
grgit.log {
  range('origin/master', 'HEAD')
}
----

Returns a `List<Commit>` (link:http://ajoberstar.org/grgit/docs/grgit-core/groovydoc/org/ajoberstar/grgit/Commit.html[Commit]) with the commits matching the criteria given.

== Options

includes:: (`List<Object>`, default `[]`) Commit-ish object names to include the history of in the output. For a more complete list of ways to spell commit names, see link:grgit-resolve.html[grgit-resolve] (specifically the `toCommit` method).
excludes:: (`List<Object>`, default `[]`) Commit-ish object names to exclude the history of in the output. For a more complete list of ways to spell commit names, see link:grgit-resolve.html[grgit-resolve] (specifically the `toCommit` method).
skipCommits:: (`int`, default `-1`) Skip `skipCommits` commits before starting to show the commit output. A negative value ignores this option.
maxCommits:: (`int`, default `-1`) Limit the number of commits to output. A negative value ignores this option.
paths:: (`List<String>`, defaul: `[]`) Commits modifying the given paths are selected. Omitting this will include all reachable commits.

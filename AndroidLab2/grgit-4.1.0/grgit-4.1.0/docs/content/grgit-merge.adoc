== Name

grgit-merge - Join two or more development histories together

== Synopsis

[source, groovy]
----
grgit.merge(head: <revstr>, mode: <mode>, message: <message>)
----

[source, groovy]
----
grgit.merge {
  head = <revstr>
  mode = <mode>
  message = <message>
}
----

== Description

Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch. This command is used by link:grgit-pull.html[grgit-pull] to incorporate changes from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into another.

Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "master":

----
	  A---B---C topic
	 /
    D---E---F---G master
----

Then `grgit.merge(head: 'topic')` will replay the changes made on the topic branch since it diverged from master (i.e., `E`) until its current commit `C` on top of master, and record the result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent commits and a log message from the user describing the changes.

----
	  A---B---C topic
	 /         \
    D---E---F---G---H master
----

This is a simplified version of merge. If any conflict occurs the merge will throw an exception. The conflicting files can be identified with link:grgit-status.html[grgit-status].

== Options

head:: (`Object`, default `null`) Commit, usually another branch head, to merge into our branch.  For a more complete list of acceptable inputs, see link:grgit-resolve.html[grgit-resolve] (specifically the `toRevisionString` method).
mode:: (`String`, default `default`) Must be one of `default`, `only-ff`, `create-commit`, `squash`, `no-commit`.
`default`:::: When the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update the branch pointer, without creating a merge commit.
`only-ff`:::: Refuse to merge and fail with an exception unless the current `HEAD` is already up-to-date or the merge can be resolved as a fast-forward.
`create-commit`:::: Create a merge commit even when the merge resolves as a fast-forward.
`squash`:::: Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually make a commit, move the `HEAD`, or record `$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD` (to cause the next git commit command to create a merge commit). This allows you to create a single commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or more in case of an octopus).
`no-commit`:::: Perform the merge but pretend the merge failed and do not autocommit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further tweak the merge result before committing.
message:: (`String`, default `null`) Use the given <msg> as the merge commit message.

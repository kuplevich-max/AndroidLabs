== Description

[IMPORTANT]
====
JSCH authentication (and its agent proxy) are not supported in Grgit 3.x.

If you're using Grgit 2.x, see the link:grgit-authentication-2.html[documentation] for that version.
====

Grgit communicates with remote repositories in one of three ways:

. HTTP(S) protocol with basic auth credentials (i.e. username/password).
+
TIP: Where possible, use of HTTPS urls is preferred over the SSH options. It has far simpler behavior than the SSH options.
. SSH protocol using `ssh` or `plink` directly. This approach should work as long as you can push/pull on your machine.
+
TIP: You should be using an SSH agent to have your key loaded before Grgit runs.

== HTTP BasicAuth Credentials

These are presented in precedence order (direct parameter in code, system properties, environment variables).

=== Parameter to Grgit operations

Some Grgit operations, such as link:grgit-clone.html[grgit-clone] allow you to provide credentials programmatically.

[source, groovy]
----
import org.ajoberstar.grgit.Grgit
import org.ajoberstar.grgit.Credentials

def grgit = Grgit.clone(dir: '...', url: '...', credentials: new Credentials(username, password))
----

=== System Properties

org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.username:: Username to provide when basic authentication credentials are needed. Username can be specified without a password (e.g. using a GitHub auth token as the user and providing no password).
org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.password:: Password to provide when basic authentication credentials are needed.

=== Environment Variables

GRGIT_USER:: Username to provide when basic authentication credentials are needed. Username can be specified without a password (e.g. using a GitHub auth token as the user and providing no password).
GRGIT_PASS:: Password to provide when basic authentication credentials are needed.

== SSH

If the `GIT_SSH` environment variable is set, that command will be used. If not, Grgit will scan your `PATH` for an `ssh` (preferred) or `plink` command.

Any keys your `ssh` or `plink` can natively pick up will be used. This should include keys in default locations (e.g. `~/`) and any compatible SSH agent or OS keychain.

[CAUTION]
====
Grgit cannot provide credentials to the system `ssh` or `plink` commands. If your key is password protected and not loaded in an agent, authentication _will_ fail **or** hang indefinitely.
====

== Examples

This is a non-exhaustive list of examples of how to configure authentication in common scenarios.

=== Using a GitHub auth token with HTTPS URLs

Set the environment variable `GRGIT_USER` to your authentication token from GitHub.

=== Using a Username and Password with HTTPS URLs

Set the system properties:

----
groovy -Dorg.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.username=someone -Dorg.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.password=mysecretpassword myscript.groovy
----

=== Using ssh-agent

Make sure your ssh-agent is started and your key is loaded. Then just run your application or script.

=== Using Pageant

Make sure your Pageant is started and your key is loaded. Then just run your application or script.
